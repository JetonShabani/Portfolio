import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I am a Junior Full Stack Web Developer just graduated from WBS Coding School in Berlin who is highly motivated and wants to constantly grow and never stop learning, because I think "Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world".

After graduating high school in computer science, I decided not to go to university in 2013, because I needed to work to support my family, so I put my dreams in a box (I planned to be a web developer after graduating from university). 
Now since 2020 I've opened that box again, and I've decided that the dreams of the past will be my future and I'll mix it up to become a great developer, creating useful things for humanity, a great husband and a great dad.

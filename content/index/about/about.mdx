import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I am a highly motivated Junior Full Stack Web Developer who wants to constantly grow and never stop learning, because I think that education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world.

When I decided not to go to university, to support my family, which had a lot of debts, (even though I was very young) I put my dreams in a box (I intended to be a web developer, after graduating in computer science). Now since 2020 I have reopened that box, and I have decided that the dreams of the past will be my future and I will mix it all to become a Great Developer, creating useful things for Humanity, a great Husband and a great Dad.

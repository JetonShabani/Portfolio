import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I am a highly motivated Junior Full Stack Web Developer who wants to constantly grow and never stop learning, because I think education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world.

When I decided not to go to college, in order to support my family, who had lots of debt, (although very young) I put my dreams in the box (I intended to be a web developer, after graduating in computer science).  Now since 2020 I have reopened that box and decided that the dreams of the past will be the future and I will mix it all up to be a Great Developer helping the world by doing useful things for Humanity, a great Husband and a great Dad.

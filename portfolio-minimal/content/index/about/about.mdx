import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I am a passionate Full Stack Web Developer who wants to constantly grow without ever stopping and never looking back.

when I decided not to go to university, to help my family to work and get out of debt (even if at a very young age) I put my dream in the drawer (I wanted to become a web developer after graduating in computer science at high school).
Now from 2020, I have reopened that drawer and I have decided that my dream of the past will be my future and I want to mix everything together to become a great Web Developer,
a good husband and a good father.
